Stacked hatch cover is a new type of hatch cover similar to the side-shift type, which is powered by the oil pump, and the winch drives the hatch cover to slide on the fixed track to the storage compartment installed with the oil cylinder. The hatch covers are stacked on top of each other in the storage compartment, this kind of hatch cover saves space, saves labor and material resources, is safe and reliable, and is mainly used in small and medium-sized ships, which has a huge space for development.
